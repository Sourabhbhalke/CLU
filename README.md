# Chatbots and CLU

## Overview
**Chatbots and CLU** is a project focused on creating, managing, and enhancing chatbots with Conversational Language Understanding (CLU). This repository serves as the backend for integrating multiple chatbot frameworks, NLP models, and cloud-based AI services.

## Features
- **Multi-chatbot Integration**: Supports various chatbot frameworks (Google CX, Dialogflow, Rasa, etc.).
- **CLU Implementation**: Seamless integration of conversational AI models for enhanced natural language understanding.
- **Scalable Backend**: Designed for handling multiple chatbot instances across diverse platforms.
- **Cloud Compatibility**: Compatible with AWS, Azure, and GCP for hosting and deployment.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/sourabhbhalke/chatbots-and-CLU.git
   cd chatbots-and-CLU

2. Set up the environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the server:

python app.py

###  **Add the ZIP File to GitHub**  
Place the ZIP file in your repository under a `releases/` or `artifacts/` directory. Ensure you provide the download link in the `README.md` for convenience.

---

###  **Test the Import Process**  
Before publishing, test the ZIP file on a clean Dialogflow CX instance to verify that all configurations import correctly and no dependencies are missing.

---

### **Considerations for Other Platforms**  
- If the chatbot might be used on platforms other than Dialogflow CX, include scripts or tools (if feasible) to help users adapt the configuration for those platforms.
- Specify platform dependencies (e.g., the language model, flow logic) in the documentation.
